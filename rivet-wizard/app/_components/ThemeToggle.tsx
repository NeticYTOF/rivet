  // a fourth gear. The button's label still names the ACTION ("Switch to light
  // mode"), so state and affordance never contradict each other.
  //
  // Until the effect has read the stamp, fall back to night: it is the default
  // palette, so the server HTML and the first client render already agree —
  // crescent + "Switch to light mode" — and nothing has to be patched. Reading
  // the attribute in a state initialiser instead would put "light" in the server
  // HTML of a day-theme page, which React would then have to patch — or, with
  // suppressHydrationWarning, leave showing the wrong icon all day.
